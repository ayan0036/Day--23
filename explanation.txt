 In Angular, two-way data binding allows synchronization between the component's data (TypeScript) and the UI (HTML template) in real-time. This means any change made in the input field updates the component property automatically, and vice versa. Angular provides a directive called ngModel to achieve this two-way binding. The syntax [(ngModel)]="propertyName" is a combination of property binding [ ] and event binding ( ), which keeps the data flow in both directions. Internally, [ngModel] binds the initial value to the input field, and (ngModelChange) listens for user input events to update the component's property accordingly. This approach ensures that the UI and the underlying data model remain in sync without writing additional event listeners or manual DOM manipulations.
